# FutureOfBlockChain
Future of BlockChain Competition Entry

We managaed to create and end to end application which has the potential to message accross WAN. The idea is that there's a main server, which clients can connect to and send messages and the server controls all the information that's been sent and can see which clients are active. After successfully creating this aspect to the program, we cleared some network issues to do with firewall and moved onto understanding the internals of NuCypher.

We began setting up virtual environments using python-env and then downloading NuCypher onto it, and bring the Git-Repo from NuCypher to try and plug and play with some of the demos. We configured our own Ursula's and managed to assign them to our own IP and set our own ports and then access them via web browsers

Issues Encountered:

1) Response has not attribute "data" - potentially a wrong file or the methodology of sending the information is quite weak.
2) No response from teacher ursula when trying to connect them across the network
3) Multitude of install and dependecies errors, which shall be fetting fixed.
