0.0.2 (current development version)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **CHANGED:** a ``PerformanceParameters`` object needs to be specialized for the device used (by calling its ``for_device()`` method) before passing it to gates.

* **CHANGED:** instead of using ``numpy.random.RandomState`` for key generation and encryption, ``DeterministicRNG`` and ``SecureRNG`` are available instead. The former is the wrapped ``RandomState``, fast, but not cryptographically secure; the latter is the secure random source provided by the OS, which can be rather slow.

* ADDED: a high-level API hiding the Reikna details and removing some boilerplate.

* ADDED: shape checks in gate functions that take into account possible broadcasting.

* FIXED: a bug in ``tlwe_noiseless_trivial()`` occasionally leading to memory corruption.

* FIXED: a bug where ``PerformanceParameters`` and ``PerformanceParametersForDevice`` objects did not have a correct equality implementation, leading to unnecessary re-compilation of kernels.

* FIXED: compilation failing when ``transforms_per_block`` in ``PerformanceParameters`` is set too high.
